# Translator

 This tool makes translating of datapacks easier, if you translate sounds and textures, or if you wouldn't like to use resource packs for text translating.

## Dependencies

 The Translator utilizes functions from NBTparser. You can download it [here](https://github.com/Jerozgen/NBTparser).

## Combine Mode

 Use the combine mode while adding the Translator as a dependency to your project, so the library will be able to get access to the language folder of your project.
